# Pondi
Pondi: A low-cost aquatic and terrestrial CO2 and CH4 emissions logger, developed by ASU's Dept. of Physics & Astronomy for ASU's Dept. of Biology. This repository contains the main sensor node script for the Pondi device. Not included in this repository but accompanying this script are separate AWS python Lambda functions for data/command routing and a HTML dashboard. This Pondi is based off of the original concept paper by Malerba et. al. 2025
